# Prophet Web Interface - User Manual

## Welcome to Privacy-First Forecasting

The Prophet Web Interface is designed with your privacy as the top priority. This manual will guide you through using the application while understanding how we protect your data at every step.

## üîí Privacy-First Design

### Your Data Never Leaves Your Control

- **No Server Storage**: Your data is processed entirely in server memory and immediately discarded
- **Session-Only Processing**: Data exists only during your active session (maximum 2 hours)

- **No Logging**: We never log, cache, or store any of your actual data
- **Client-Side Preferences**: Your settings are stored only in your browser cookies and local storage

### What This Means for You

‚úÖ **Complete Privacy**: Your sensitive business data never touches a database or file system  
‚úÖ **GDPR Compliant**: No personal data storage means no privacy compliance concerns
