# Privacy Policy and Data Handling

## Prophet Web Interface Privacy Policy

**Effective Date**: January 1, 2024  
**Last Updated**: January 1, 2024

## Our Privacy Commitment

The Prophet Web Interface is built with a **privacy-first architecture** that ensures your data never leaves your control. This isn't just a policy promise—it's how we designed and built the entire system from the ground up.

## The Simple Truth: We Don't Store Your Data

**We cannot access, store, or share your data because we never save it in the first place.**

- ✅ Your data is processed entirely in server memory
- ✅ All data is automatically deleted when processing completes
- ✅ No databases, file systems, or caches store your information
- ✅ Even we cannot recover your data once your session ends

## What Data We Process (Temporarily)

### Data You Upload
- **CSV files** containing your time series data
- **Processing**: Parsed and analyzed entirely in server memory
- **Duration**: Exists only during your active session (maximum 2 hours)
- **Disposal**: Automatically and securely deleted when session ends

### Configuration Data
- **Forecasting parameters** you set for Prophet models
- **Processing**: Used to configure models in memory only
- **Storage**: You can download configurations as JSON files to your device
- **Server Storage**: None - configurations exist only during your session

### Results and Forecasts
- **Forecast predictions** generated by Prophet models
- **Charts and visualizations** created from your data
- **Processing**: Generated in memory and displayed to you immediately
- **Persistence**: None - results must be downloaded to your device to keep them

## What We Store (Minimal Browser Data Only)

### Browser Cookies (Your Device Only)
- **User interface preferences** (theme, default settings)
- **Session identifiers** (temporary, expire automatically)
- **Purpose**: Improve your user experience across visits
- **Control**: You can clear these anytime through your browser settings

### Browser Local Storage (Your Device Only)
- **Model templates** you create and save
- **Interface configurations** for convenience
- **Purpose**: Allow you to reuse settings without server storage
- **Control**: Managed entirely by your browser, cleared when you clear browser data

## What We Never Store

❌ **Your CSV files or datasets**  
❌ **Your forecast results**  
❌ **Your business data or time series**  
❌ **Personal information or identifiers**  
❌ **Usage analytics tied to your data**  
❌ **Error logs containing your data**  
❌ **Backup copies of any user data**  
❌ **Cached or temporary files with your data**  

## How Our Privacy-First Architecture Works

### Memory-Only Processing

```
1. Upload → Direct to RAM (never disk)
2. Process → All operations in volatile memory
3. Results → Generated in memory, displayed immediately
4. Cleanup → Automatic secure memory clearing
5. Download → You control what data leaves (to your device only)
```

### Session Management

- **Session Creation**: Temporary identifier generated for your browser session
- **Data Isolation**: Your data is completely separate from other users
- **Automatic Expiry**: Sessions expire after 2 hours of inactivity
- **Secure Cleanup**: Cryptographic-grade memory clearing when sessions end
- **No Persistence**: Session data never survives server restarts

### Technical Implementation

Our privacy protection is implemented at the system architecture level:

- **No Database Connections**: The application has no database connectivity
- **No File System Writes**: User data never touches the disk
- **Memory Isolation**: Each session uses isolated memory spaces
- **Automatic Garbage Collection**: Explicit memory clearing after each operation
- **Stateless Design**: No server-side state means no data to compromise

## Data Processing Locations

### Server Processing
- **Location**: Render.com cloud infrastructure (United States)
- **Purpose**: Prophet model training and forecasting computations
- **Duration**: Only during active processing (seconds to minutes)
- **Security**: Data processed in encrypted memory, never written to disk

### Client Processing
- **Location**: Your browser and device
- **Purpose**: User interface, preferences, downloaded results
- **Control**: Entirely under your control
- **Storage**: Only what you choose to save locally

## Your Rights and Controls

### Complete Data Control
- **Download Anytime**: Export all results and configurations before they're deleted
- **Session Management**: End your session anytime to trigger immediate data cleanup
- **Browser Control**: Manage cookies and local storage through browser settings
- **No Account Required**: No registration means no personal data to manage

### Transparency Rights
- **Source Code**: Application architecture is documented and verifiable
- **Privacy Verification**: Built-in endpoints to verify privacy compliance
- **Audit Logs**: System logs contain no user data, only performance metrics
- **Open Design**: Privacy-first architecture is publicly documented

### Data Portability
- **Export Formats**: CSV, JSON, PNG, SVG, PDF for all results
- **Configuration Export**: Download model settings as JSON files
- **No Lock-in**: All data exports use standard, open formats
- **Immediate Access**: Download results as soon as they're generated

## Security Measures

### Data in Transit
- **HTTPS Encryption**: All communications encrypted with TLS 1.3
- **Secure Headers**: Content Security Policy and other security headers
- **No Caching**: Sensitive data never cached by browsers or CDNs

### Data in Processing
- **Memory Encryption**: Server memory encrypted at rest
- **Process Isolation**: Each session runs in isolated memory space
- **Secure Disposal**: Cryptographic clearing of memory after use
- **No Swap Files**: Memory configured to never swap to disk

### Infrastructure Security
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Stateless design reduces security risks
- **No Persistent Storage**: Nothing to steal or compromise
- **Regular Security Updates**: Automated security patching
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for security anomalies (no user data logged)

## Compliance and Standards

### Privacy Regulations
- **GDPR Compliant**: No personal data storage means no GDPR obligations
- **CCPA Compliant**: No data sale or sharing because we don't store data
- **HIPAA Friendly**: Suitable for healthcare data due to no-storage design
- **SOX Compliant**: Financial data can be processed safely

### Industry Standards
- **ISO 27001 Principles**: Security management best practices
- **NIST Framework**: Cybersecurity framework compliance
- **Privacy by Design**: Built-in privacy from system architecture
- **Zero Trust**: No trust assumptions about data handling

## Third-Party Services

### Render.com (Hosting Provider)
- **Service**: Cloud hosting infrastructure
- **Data Access**: No access to user data (data exists only in application memory)
- **Privacy Policy**: [Render Privacy Policy](https://render.com/privacy)
- **Compliance**: SOC 2 Type II certified

### No Other Third Parties
- **Analytics**: No third-party analytics services
- **Tracking**: No advertising or tracking pixels
- **CDN**: Static assets only, no user data
- **Monitoring**: System performance only, no user data

## Incident Response

### Data Breach Protocol
**In the unlikely event of a security incident:**

1. **Immediate Assessment**: Determine if any user data could be affected
2. **Reality Check**: Remember that no user data is stored to be breached
3. **System Verification**: Confirm privacy architecture integrity
4. **User Notification**: Transparent communication about any potential impact
5. **Improvement**: Enhance security measures based on lessons learned

### What a "Breach" Would Mean for You
- **Your Data**: Safe because it's not stored on our servers
- **Your Privacy**: Protected because there's nothing to compromise
- **Your Risk**: Minimal because the architecture prevents data exposure

## Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect or process data from children under 13. Since we don't store any personal data, this protection is built into our architecture. If you're under 13, please have a parent or guardian review this policy with you.

## International Data Transfers

### Data Processing Location
- **Primary**: United States (Render.com infrastructure)
- **Duration**: Only during active processing sessions
- **Protection**: Data never persists long enough for transfer concerns
- **Compliance**: Meets international privacy standards through no-storage design
